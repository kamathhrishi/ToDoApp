# Web-Trials
 My trials trying to do stuff from scratch to become a better web developer :). Not particularly limnited to this repository , but the small projects that are not too small or could bbe shared. 
 
 <ul>
 
 <li><a href="https://github.com/kamathhrishi/Web-Trials/tree/master/To%20Do%20App-Angular">To Do App</a></li>
 A simple CRUD ToDoApp I developed to grasp basics of Bootstrap 3 and AngularJs without databases for storage.
 
  <li><a href="https://github.com/kamathhrishi/Web-Trials/tree/master/Bookmarker">Bookmarker Application</a></li>
 Almost similar to the previous project , but with the use of Vanilla Javascript and HTML5 Local Storage and Bootstrap 4 for UI.


 
 </ul>
